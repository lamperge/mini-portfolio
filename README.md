# mini-portfolio
 
This was the first project I did after starting the JavaScript course.
It contains some of my exercises that I did during the course.

### Contador (Counter) 

In this exercise I design I trained my ability to manipulate DOM, variables and Loops, which was very helpful for me to really understand the possibilities and applicability of loops in JavaScript. Something that was not very clear to me at first.

### Idade (Age)

Here's my first exercise practicing the "if" and also a great deal of HTML manipulation by JS. I put a lot of effort into completing this exercise, not in the sense that it was difficult to learn but really in the amount of time and energy to do, especially the design, but in the end it was worth it.

### Tabuada (Multiplication Table)

In this one I also used repetitions and I also trained the select tag well, which I had never used before.
